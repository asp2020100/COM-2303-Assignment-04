<p><strong>Building a portfolio webpage</strong><br />Now that you have built the foundation of your portfolio webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it's time to add server-side functionality using PHP. Your task is to further enhance your webpage by incorporating the following PHP features:</p>
<p><br />1. Form Validation and Input Sanitization:<br />● Implement PHP code to validate and sanitize the following fields in your<br />contact form:<br />● Name: Ensure it contains only letters and spaces.<br />● Email: Validate the email format.<br />● Message: Avoid any potential malicious code or HTML tags.<br />● Display appropriate error messages if any field fails validation.</p>
<p><br />2. Database Integration:<br />● Create a MySQL database to store project details. Design a table with the<br />following columns:<br />● ID: A unique identifier for each project.<br />● Title: The title of the project.<br />● Description: A brief description of the project.<br />● Image: Store the image path or URL for each project.<br />● Implement PHP functions to:<br />● Establish a database connection.<br />● Insert new project details into the database.<br />● Retrieve project data from the database.<br />● Update project information.<br />● Delete projects if necessary.</p>
<p><br />3. User Authentication:<br />● Create a table in the database to store user account details. Include<br />columns such as:<br />● ID: A unique identifier for each user.<br />● Username: The username chosen by the user.<br />● Password: The hashed password for secure storage.<br />● Implement PHP functions to handle user registration and login:<br />● Register: Validate and insert new user details into the database.<br />● Login: Verify the entered username and password against the<br />stored values.<br />● Use PHP sessions to keep track of authenticated users.</p>
<p><br />4. PHP Functions:<br />● Create a PHP file named functions.php to contain your custom functions.<br />● Write functions such as:<br />● validateForm(): Perform form validation and return an array of error<br />messages.<br />● connectDatabase(): Establish a database connection and return the<br />connection object.<br />● insertProject(): Insert project details into the database.<br />● getProjects(): Retrieve project data from the database.<br />● updateProject(): Update project information in the database.<br />● deleteProject(): Delete projects from the database.<br />● Customize additional functions based on your specific<br />requirements.</p>
<p><br />Remember to incorporate these PHP features in a way that aligns with the overall<br />design and interactivity of your portfolio webpage. Implement error handling and<br />provide clear feedback to users in case of any issues. Test your PHP features<br />thoroughly to ensure they function as intended and follow best practices for security and data handling.</p>
<p><br />Note: The specific tables, columns, and functions mentioned above are just examples.You can modify them based on your project's requirements and desired functionality.</p>
